## üöß Road Accident Data Analysis Project

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of road accident data using **Excel** and **Power BI**. 
The goal of the analysis is to understand the distribution of road accidents and casualties 
under different weather conditions and road types. The dashboard provides insights into **total casualties**, 
**accidents**, and **casualty severity levels** (fatal, serious, slight) during **snow**, **fine weather**, 
and **rainy seasons**. Additionally, the project breaks down casualties by **road type**, **urban/rural location**, 
**specific locations**, and **vehicle types** under **dry**, **snow-covered**, and **wet** road conditions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è KPI Generation Process

1. **Data Cleaning in Excel**  
   - Removed null or irrelevant records  
   - Standardized categories for weather, road type, and severity  
   - Ensured consistency in location and vehicle type fields  

2. **Data Import to Power BI**  
   - Loaded cleaned dataset from Excel  
   - Created data model and relationships  

3. **KPI Calculation**  
   - Used DAX to calculate totals and break down by conditions (e.g., weather, road type)  
   - Created calculated measures for fatal, serious, and slight casualties  

4. **Dashboard Design**  
   - Developed visual representations for each KPI  
   - Incorporated filters for seasons, road conditions, and regions  
   - Enabled drill-downs for detailed location and vehicle-type analysis

## üí° Project Insights

- **Snow season** had a noticeably higher percentage of **serious** and **fatal** casualties compared to other seasons.  
- **Rainy season** resulted in the highest number of **total accidents**, but with fewer fatal outcomes.  
- Casualties were significantly higher on **urban dry roads** due to greater traffic density.  
- **Wet roads** saw more casualties involving **two-wheelers and passenger vehicles**, especially in urban areas.  
- **Rural snow roads** had the highest fatality rate per accident, despite fewer total incidents.

## ‚úÖ Final Conclusion

The Road Accident Data Analysis dashboard provides actionable insights into how weather, road type, and location affect accident outcomes. By identifying high-risk conditions and environments, this analysis can support road safety initiatives, emergency response planning, and infrastructure development strategies to reduce casualties and improve public safety.
